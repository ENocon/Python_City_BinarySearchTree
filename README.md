# Python_City_BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree Project. 

Reads a text document of international cities and populations. With this information, the program creates city objects, which possess two data types (the city name and the city population.). The program then creates nodes; the value of which is the city object. The program constructs a binary tree using an insert method coded with recursion. After the binary tree is constructed, an in order traversal is performed utilizing recursion once more to print the cities to the console in order of smallest population to largest.
